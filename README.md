# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis

## Analysis Overview:

The analysis consists of a summary of ride-sharing data by city type.  Data will be analyzed to find differences between the city types by total fare.  From the information we will show the differences among the different city types.

##Results:

The results of our analysis indicate Rural cities earn the highest fare average per ride with the least number of total rides but have the lowest total fares with $4,327.93.  The Suburban cities are in the middle of average fare per ride with total fares with $19,356.33. The Urban cities have the largest total fares with $39,854.38 which is shared by a total of 2,405 drivers.  Which gives each driver an average of $16.57, the lowest of the three city types.
